# MOGO: A CASE STUDY 
### A FINTECH COMMITED TO  FINANCIAL FREEDOM FOR ALL 


### **Origin Story** 


In 2008 the world of finance was in the midst of one the worst financial crises to hit in more than 75 years. Many people faced loss of employment, savings and investments. It was also the year that Mogo was founded and given their mission their founding couldn't have come at a time of greater need. 

Mogo provides personal finance management tools for consumers. It was founded by the Feller brothers, David and Gregory, with the mission of making it easy for Canadians to achieve financial freedom, while making a positive impact. 

It's founders were uniquely focused on helping people pay off their credit card loans by taking out a loan on clear and transparent borrowing terms. 

The company has raised CAD 263.8 MM infunding over 8 rounds. They did their IPO on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2015 and also did a post-IPO fundraising round. 

### **Business Activities**

Mogoâ€™s primary service offering is a way to simplify the process by which people can manage their financial health. They do this by combinining several key FinTech developments for payments, wealth management, lending, into a
single application for consumers which is easy to use. 

The identified total addressable market (TAM) equates to 10m millennials and 7m genz, all of whom are mobile natives. By combining multiple financial services into a single system Mogo can target the consumer credit, payments and mortgage markets at once. In addition to this, since 2018 they decided to invest in R&D to drive growth for new products, enhancing features and optimized UI/UX.

By incorporating impact into their marketing and brand strategy, the company is able to create strengthened brand loyalty amongst its users. They are one of the few finance apps that focus quite heavily on showing the significance of creating social impact by planting trees and offsetting numerous negative environmental effects including reducing CO2 by sequestering carbon, reducing the effects of soil erosion and increasing biodiversity in regions of the world its most needed. This aspect of their business strategy is a unique value proposition that sets them apart from their competitors.

In addition to this they offer commission free trading, zero foreign exchange fees and free live streaming stock prices. By offering these free services they truly do live up to their motto of allowing the consumer to do more (investing), by spending less.

Their tech stack includes Javascript, Ruby, Golang. Alongside Redis, Docker, Github and Kibana on the Devops side. While they offer their users the chance to trade crypto they are not using blockchain technology for supporting their platform as of now. 

### **Landscape**

Mogo offers a range of financial services but its primary focus is providing investment opportunities to consumers.

Wealth management used to be a luxury the wealthiest were most familiar with. And trading on the stick exchange was a specialized skill till a few decades ago. Investment for most people was limited to commodity and real estate holdings. But with the rapid growth of fintech we see the emergence of technology and services that allow for free investment, e-lending, crowdfunding, even digitzed venture investment. With AI we see that robo advisers are increasingly reducing the need for middlemen in these digitized processes.

Some big players in this space are Robinhood, Credit Karma, Wealthsimple and other financial companies, including banks, that have built their own tech platforms to digitize customer services and product offerings etc.

### **Results**

Mogo's earnings report for 2022 showed a 20% increase in revenue YOY. They also made acquisitions for Carta, a digital payments solution that manages equity disbursements for businesses. As well as a 34% stake in Coinsquare, a crypto investment dealer.

They launched their trading app in Quebec to increase their marketshare to French speaking demographic and increasing their TAM by 28%. Despite being an invitation only app.

Mogo's digital payment solutions business, Carta Worldwide, processed over $2.2 billion of payments volume in Q4 2022 which was up over 20% sequentially from Q3 2022.

Mogo seems to be doing well in comparison with its competitors such as Borrowell and Spring Financial, which are much smaller at this stage. Wealthsimple is a much bigger competitor but their pricing structure doesn't offer as many free services as Mogo's. This feature will make Mogo a more attractive option to younger investors. Wealthsimple also has no option to offer the opportunity to create impact with investment choices. 

On the other side Mogo deprecated their crypto trading services last year so some other apps will have an edge there. 

### **Recommendations**

My recommendation to Mogo would be to reintroduce crypto trading on the platform, however limit it to safer tokens such as commodity backed coins or more well known currencies such as Bitcoin, Eth and Litecoin. 

I would also suggest to them to offer more services related to impact based investing. This could be in the form of investing in socially conscientious businesses by flagging these businesses. Or to support donations to non-profits. This could help them reduce churn and improve retention and possibly even attract more socially conscious investors to the platform.

I would also recommend them to use robo-advisors and AI based technology to automate more routine functions. The company had to cut 34% of their workforce to improve cost efficiency. This could've been avoided if they had better AI models in place to make their platform smarter and more cost-effective from the start. Roboadvising is a fintech trend more financial companies are relying on and is a great fit for Mogo's platform.
